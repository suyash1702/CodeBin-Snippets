create new app in angular 
Certainly! Let's create an Angular project step by step. Here's a concise guide:

1. **Install Angular CLI** (Command Line Interface):
   - If you haven't already, install Angular CLI globally using npm:
     ```
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

2. **Create a New Angular Project**:
   - Run the following command to create a new project (replace `myNewApp` with your desired project name):
     ```
     ng new myNewApp
     ```
   - Choose 'yes' for routing and select either CSS or SCSS for styling.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   - Change into your project directory:
     ```
     cd myNewApp
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Launch the application with the following command:
     ```
     ng serve --open
     ```
   - The `--open` flag opens your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200), where you'll see your Angular app running.

5. **Create Components**, configure routes, and add content to your components as needed.
